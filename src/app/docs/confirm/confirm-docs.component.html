        <p>
          A confirmation dialog focuses user attention on a specific question. It is appropriate for scenarios that meet the following criteria:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            An action could be destructive or especially costly when performed by mistake.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users must respond to a single question to proceed with the action.
          </li>
          <li>
            The response to the question requires no input fields.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The question portion of the dialog must contain only one question.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            The text can be more than one sentence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Do not use this component if the context of the question requires significant explanation, illustration, or dynamic feedback of downstream consequences.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The answer portion of the dialog answers the question or tells users what will happen. It can contain up to 3 choices represented as terminal actions (buttons) that should reiterate the action to take. The button labels should clearly indicate what action occurs when users select the button. For example, use "Delete" for the primary button text if the question is "Are you sure you want to delete this draft?"
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            A primary button triggers the recommended or most-common action.
          </li>
          <li>
            A secondary button can trigger a less-common action.
          </li>
          <li>
            A link button cancels the action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each button closes the dialog.
          </li>
        </ul>
