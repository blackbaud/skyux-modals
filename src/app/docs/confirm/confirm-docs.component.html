          A confirmation dialog focuses user attention on a specific question and is appropriate for scenarios that meet the following criteria:
        </p>

        <ul class="sky-docs-text-block">
          <li>
            An action could be destructive or especially costly when performed by mistake.
          </li>
          <li>
            Users must respond to a single question to proceed with the action.
          </li>
          <li>
            The response to the question requires no input fields.

          The question portion of the dialog must contain only one question.
        </p>

        <ul class="sky-docs-text-block">
          <li>
            The text can be more than one sentence.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be concise and direct. Don't use this component if the context of the question requires significant explanation, illustration, or dynamic feedback of downstream consequences.
          </li>
          <li>
            Avoid verbose or complicated phrasing. For example, only start questions with “Are you sure you want to” in rare cases where you need to emphasize that users should think twice before proceeding.
          </li>

        <p class="sky-docs-text-block">
          The answer portion of the dialog answers the question or tells users what will happen. It contains up to three options that are represented as terminal actions (buttons) with labels that clearly indicate the action that occurs when users select the buttons. For example, use "Delete" for the primary button text when the question asks users to confirm that they want to delete something, such as "Delete account?"
        </p>

        <ul class="sky-docs-text-block">
          <li>
            A primary button triggers the recommended or most-common action.
          </li>
          <li>
            A secondary button triggers a less-common action.
          </li>
          <li>
            A link button cancels the action.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each button closes the dialog.
